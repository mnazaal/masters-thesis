# Causal Discovery Algorithms for Context-Specific Trees

This git repository contains all the relevant material for my masters thesis. The main files of interest are the `.org` files, which allow to compile to LaTeX documents, beamer presentations, and even HTML pages with Twitter bootstrap, alongside allowing me to run my code inside the document so I can perform all the workflow on emacs without needing to use a mouse/trackpad.
